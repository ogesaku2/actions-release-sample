This is an example on how to use GitHub actions to build and release a project.

- Technology-agnostic - use as little as possible technology specific tools (gradle plugins, npm executables).
- On release:
    - Update version in config files and and docs
    - Generate a tag - format `v1.2.3`
    - Create a branch - only if major version was changes, format: `v1.x.x`
    - Create autogenerated GitHub release notes
- Publish docs - on change in master
